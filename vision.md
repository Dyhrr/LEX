# ðŸŽ¯ Lex Vision: 5-Year Plan

Lex is not just a desktop assistant. He is the foundation of a digital ecosystem that integrates into your life with precision, discretion, and intelligence. This document outlines the future goals and architectural vision for Lex.

## ðŸ”’ Philosophy

- **Local-first**: No reliance on the cloud unless explicitly enabled.
- **Secure by default**: No telemetry, no analytics, fully transparent.
- **Extensible**: Everything is modular, plugin-based, and user-controlled.
- **Portable**: Lex will follow you across devices, not data centers.

- Power control, audio routing
- Passive system logging

### Phase 4: Mobile Companion
- Lightweight Android app
